# TURTLE-RACE

This project is a simple turtle race game implemented using the Python turtle module. Users can bet on which turtle will win the race and watch the race unfold in a graphical window.

# Features
Interactive betting prompt for users to choose their turtle.
Six colorful turtles race across the screen.
Random movement for each turtle to simulate the race.
Display of the winning turtle and the result of the user's bet.
# Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Install the turtle module if it's not already installed. The turtle module is included in the Python Standard Library, so you usually don't need to install it separately. However, if for some reason you need to install it, you can use pip:

# bash
pip install PythonTurtle
# Usage
Save the script to a file, e.g., turtle_race.py.

# Run the script:

# bash
python turtle_race.py
When prompted, enter your bet for which turtle (color) you think will win the race.

Watch the race and see if your chosen turtle wins!
